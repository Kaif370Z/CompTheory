    "# 0-1 Knapsack Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The 0-1 knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem that arises in many different fields. In this notebook, we will explore the 0-1 knapsack problem in detail, design an efficient algorithm to solve it, and analyze its complexity. [^1] [^2]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The 0-1 knapsack problem can be defined as follows:\n",
    "- Given `n` items, each with a weight `w_i` and a value `v_i`, and a knapsack with a maximum weight capacity `W`, the objective is to determine the number of each item to include in the knapsack such that the total weight does not exceed `W` and the total value is maximized. [^3] [^4]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "- You can either take an item (1) or leave it (0).\n",
    "- No fractional items are allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have the following items:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Item | Weight | Value |\n",
    "|------|--------|-------|\n",
    "| 1    | 2      | 3     |\n",
    "| 2    | 3      | 4     |\n",
    "| 3    | 4      | 5     |\n",
    "| 4    | 5      | 6     |\n",
    "\n",
    "And the knapsack has a maximum weight capacity of `W = 5`. The goal is to select the items such that the total value is maximized without exceeding the capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "The 0-1 knapsack problem has many real-world applications, including resource allocation, cargo loading, and project selection. Understanding how to solve this problem is crucial for tackling many optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Design\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use dynamic programming to solve the 0-1 knapsack problem. The key idea is to build a table `dp` where `dp[i][w]` represents the maximum value that can be achieved using the first `i` items and a total weight of `w`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. Initialize a 2D table `dp` with dimensions `(n+1) x (W+1)` where `n` is the number of items and `W` is the capacity of the knapsack.\n",
    "2. Populate the table by iterating over each item and weight capacity:\n",
    "    - If the current item's weight is less than or equal to the current weight capacity, we have two choices:\n",
    "      - Include the item and add its value to the optimal solution for the remaining capacity.\n",
    "      - Exclude the item and use the previous optimal solution for the same weight.\n",
    "    - Choose the option that gives the maximum value.\n",
    "3. The final solution will be stored in `dp[n][W]`, which represents the maximum value that can be obtained using all items within the weight limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "The time complexity of this approach is `O(nW)` where `n` is the number of items and `W` is the weight capacity of the knapsack. [^5]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "The space complexity is also `O(nW)` because we need to store the table of size `(n+1) x (W+1)`.\n"

    "\n",
    "### 1. Brute Force Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description**: \n",
    "  - Enumerate all possible subsets of the items and calculate the total weight and value for each subset.\n",
    "  - Select the subset with the highest value that does not exceed the weight capacity.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\( O(2^n) \\)\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\( O(n) \\)\n",
    "- **Pros**: Simple to understand and implement.\n",
    "- **Cons**: Highly inefficient for large `n` due to exponential time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Greedy Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description**: \n",
    "  - Sort items by value-to-weight ratio and iteratively select items with the highest ratio until the weight limit is reached.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\( O(n \\log n) \\) (due to sorting)\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\( O(n) \\)\n",
    "- **Pros**: Efficient for the fractional knapsack problem.\n",
    "- **Cons**: Does not guarantee an optimal solution for the 0-1 knapsack problem, as it may leave out high-value items.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Dynamic Programming Approach (Used in this Notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description**: \n",
    "  - Build a table or array to store the maximum values for subproblems, ensuring that each item is either included or excluded.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\( O(nW) \\)\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\( O(nW) \\) or \\( O(W) \\) with optimization.\n",
    "- **Pros**: Guarantees an optimal solution.\n",
    "- **Cons**: Slower and more memory-intensive than greedy approaches for large `W`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "While brute force and greedy algorithms can be easier to implement, they are not suitable for larger instances or when an optimal solution is required. The dynamic programming approach is the most effective for solving the 0-1 knapsack problem optimally, with the space-optimized version further improving the memory usage.\n"

    "## Time and Space Complexity Analysis\n",

    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamic programming approach to solving the 0-1 knapsack problem builds a table `dp` of size `(n+1) x (W+1)`, where `n` is the number of items and `W` is the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Filling the DP Table**: \n",
    "  - For each item, we iterate over all possible weight capacities from `1` to `W`. \n",
    "  - This involves `n` iterations for the items and `W` iterations for the weight capacity, resulting in a total time complexity of \\( O(nW) \\).\n",

    "Thus, the time complexity of the algorithm is **`O(nW)`**, where:\n",
    "- `n` is the number of items.\n",
    "- `W` is the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity of the algorithm is determined by the size of the `dp` table that stores the intermediate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DP Table**:\n",
    "  - The table has `n+1` rows (one for each item, plus one for the base case of zero items).\n",
    "  - The table has `W+1` columns (one for each weight capacity from `0` to `W`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in a space complexity of **`O(nW)`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimized Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "By optimizing the space complexity, we reduced the space requirement to **`O(W)`** by using a 1D array instead of a 2D table. This improvement is significant when dealing with large values of `W`.\n",

    "- **Time Complexity**: \\( O(nW) \\)\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\( O(nW) \\) or \\( O(W) \\) with optimization.\n",

    "### Refactoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Refactoring the current implementation could improve readability, maintainability, and scalability. Some strategies include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modularization**: Split the implementation into smaller functions that handle distinct tasks, such as building the `dp` table or processing inputs.\n",
    "2. **Use of OOP**: An object-oriented approach could encapsulate the knapsack logic in a class, which would make it easier to extend the functionality and reuse the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memoization**: Although dynamic programming avoids recomputation by storing intermediate results, a recursive implementation with memoization could provide another way to solve the problem while keeping the code simple and clear.\n",
